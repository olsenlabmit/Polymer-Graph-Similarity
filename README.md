In this work, we proposed a reliable method to quantitatively calculate the pairwise chemical similarity score for polymers, where the [earth moverâ€™s distance (EMD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_mover%27s_distance) is utilized to calculate the similarity of the repeat units and end groups, while the [graph edit distance (GED)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_edit_distance) is used to calculate the similarity of the topology. These three values then are combined to yield an overall pairwise chemical similarity score for polymers.

The repository is intended for the following use cases:

- Illustrate key ideas from the manuscript Method section including earth mover's distance and graph edit distance
- Allow for full reproducibility of the data in the manuscript

## Running the code

### Running notebooks in Google Colab

If you are interested in running one or more notebooks in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), first click on the relevant link below.

#### Notebook for main text
- [Polymer_Similarity_Method_Section_PolymerA_PolymerB](./notebook/Polymer_Similarity_Method_Section_PolymerA_PolymerB.ipynb)
- [Polymer_Similarity_Case1_Varying_Repeat_Units](./notebook/Polymer_Similarity_Case1_Varying_Repeat_Units.ipynb)
- [Polymer_Similarity_Case2_Varying_Topologies](./notebook/Polymer_Similarity_Case2_Varying_Topologies.ipynb)
- [Polymer_Similarity_Case3_Varying_Both_Repeat_Units_and_Topologies](./notebook/Polymer_Similarity_Case3_Varying_Both_Repeat_Units_and_Topologies.ipynb)
- [Polymer_Similarity_Case4_Graft_Copolymers](./notebook/Polymer_Similarity_Case4_Graft_Copolymers.ipynb) 
- [Polymer_Similarity_Case5_Segmented_Polymers](./notebook/Polymer_Similarity_Case5_Segmented_Polymers.ipynb) 

#### Notebook for supporting information
- [Polymer_Similarity_EMD_vs_Simple_Sum](./notebook/Polymer_Similarity_EMD_vs_Simple_Sum.ipynb)
- [Polymer_Similarity_Varying_Weight_Settings_for_Overall_Similarity_Score](./notebook/Polymer_Similarity_Varying_Weight_Settings_for_Overall_Similarity_Score.ipynb)
- Weighted Arithmetic Mean for Overall Similarity Score

 -
- [Polymer_Similarity_Tacticity](./notebook/Polymer_Similarity_Tacticity.ipynb)

Then open the colab badge <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab" width="75" height="15"/> in the notebook.

It will open a colab notebook. Then you can run the notebook as normal. All the required libraries and functions are present in the colab notebook.
